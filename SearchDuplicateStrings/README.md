**SearchDuplicateStrings** is a simple console program for search of repeating strings in text. If was created for purposes of romhacking.

Option that can be transmit to the program via parameter:
- format of output: as a dictionary or as a list of repeated strings

To launch the application with parameters, it is convenient to use a bat-file. The folder <code>[files_for_test](./files_for_test)</code> contains example of such file with additional explanations. Place contents of that folder in directory with built application and launch the bat-file so the application can demonstrate its work.
