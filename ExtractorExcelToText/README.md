**ExtractorExcelToText** is a program for extraction texts from Excel to a text file, with optional overlay.

**The program is in the process of creation.**

To launch the application with parameters, it is convenient to use a bat-file. The folder <code>[files_for_test](./files_for_test)</code> contains example of such file with additional explanations. Place contents of that folder in directory with built application and launch the bat-file so the application can demonstrate its work.

The ready program can be downloaded from my [Google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dVUmed45JQV0hiPo3bkBh56TnDT_o4JW).
